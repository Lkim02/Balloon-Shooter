## Problem:The original version of the game had a score display and timing by loading a .ttf font file but after generating the .exe runtime file the game doesn't work, I ran the program using the command prompt and it says that the .ttf font file can't be loaded, I've already put the font file in the folder, I've been working on this problem for a long time but it's never been solved so I've deleted the font display. function
